<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>I am a student.</h2>
<p>I am Joyanti Bhowmick.
   My favourite colours are purple and black. 
   I love to drink lemonade. I have a pet dog named Binky. 
   I love to code. I started learning to code when 
   I was 9 years old because I just wanted to 
   create my websites and games for fun. 
   Eventually soon after I started to learn coding 
   my ambition became me wanting to be a developer. If you 
   also want to learn how to program then would recomend you learn coding from this link :
